## MATLAB PROJECTS ##

SinCosAppr.m
-includes an algorithm that aproximates sine and cosine using the taylors series approximation

JacobisMethodAlgorithm.m
-includes an algorithm that approximated the solution of a specific type of linear equation using Jacobi's method

cubic_spline_differenciation.m
-uses cubic spline interpolation to estimate the first and second derivative of f(x) = e^x

nevilles_method.m
-generates a polynomial interpolation of an example function, and estimates the value of a given point on that polynomial

quadratic_root.m
-estimates the quadratic root, with rounding between each step. illustrates the difference between the standard
formula, and one chosen to reduce rounding errors
